## 🔛 In Progress

### 📝 Projects

#### Hex Survivor</br>

**Technologies Used:** Unity, C#</br>
**Status:** Ongoing</br>
This project is a turn-based 2D game developed in Unity using C#. It aims to create a maintainable, extensible, and clean codebase while learning low-level game development using C/C++ and OpenGL. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to showcase my skills in C# and Unity, as well as to gain experience by publishing a game and observing the post-launch process.
